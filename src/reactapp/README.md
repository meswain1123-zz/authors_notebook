## To Do

Try switching from bootstrap layout to material grids.  See if that will get their combobox to work right.

Add Major field to types.  Major types will each have their own section in the Things Index, including their own + Create New buttons.

Add ability to add attributes to Things.  Attributes on Things which don't have anything in FromTypes will have the ability to change the AttributeType and to delete it.  They won't have Options as an AttributeType choice.

Put Attribute Values in different field names for different attribute types.
